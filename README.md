Obviously requires a lot of manual work right now.  I'll try automating things some more in the future.

# Suggestions

ltyler suggested syncing script lines to movie frames via subtitle files (.sub)
  - grab line from script
  - match against .sub
  - grab frame from video file at timestamp

rboekweg suggested integration with fountain.io screenplay format
